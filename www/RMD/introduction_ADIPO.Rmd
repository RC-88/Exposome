An interactive portal for retrieving and visualizing data from the Adipogenome roject

### Dataset details

This experiment includes the results of taxonomic clustering of trascriptomic profiles of 38 known and 4 suspected therapeutic and environmental adipogens. 3' digital gene expression profiling was performed on mouse NIH 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes exposed over a 10 day period during differentiation. On the Adipogen Taxaonomic Clustering tab you will find a diagram on the hierarchical segregation of compounds into taxonomic sub-modules. By clicking specific nodes of the clustering diagram you will explore gene and pathway-level signatures of expression changes shared by specific sub-modules of compounds...

### Annotation

Tables detailing the chemicals/samples in the ADIPO dataset and their associated annotation.

### Chemical Explorer

Interactive explorer for a single queried chemical. 

#### Gene Expression

A list of differentially expressed genes for a given chemical of interest.

#### Gene set enrichment

Gene set enrichment scores for a given chemical of interest. Gene sets include the [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) collections (Hallmark, C2 reactome pathways), and gene targets of various nuclear receptors ([NURSA](https://www.nursa.org/nursa/transcriptomine/index.jsf)). Enrichment scores were computed based on multiple methods, including gsva, ssGSEA, zscore (from R Bioconductor package, [GSVA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html)), and gsproj (custom script).

#### Connectivity

Connectivity scores measure similarity of profiles of the query chemical to profiles in the Connectivity Map (CMap).
Scores are calculated at the level of either CMap Perturbagens or Perturbational Classes.

### Marker Explorer

Interactive explorer for a single queried markers (gene, gene-set, or CMap perturbagen/perturbagen class). 

### Heatmap Explorer

A heatmap visualizer to explore bulk visualization of gene expression, gene set enrichment, and connectivity 
results.

A interactive heatmap using Morpheus is supported for querying gene set enrichment results. For details, see [Morpheus](https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/).
