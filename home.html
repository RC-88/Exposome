      <td>HEPG2</td> 
      <td>This experiment uses 330 selected chemicals for in-vivo liver carcinogenicity testing, including 128 liver carcinogens, 168 non-carcinogens, and 34 miscellaneous chemicals (e.g. nuclear receptor ligands). Chemical carcinogenicity and genotoxicity annotations are based on the Carcinogenicity Potency Database (CPDB), which is the result of tissue-specific long-term animal cancer tests in rodents. In the liver carcinogenome project, HepG2 (liver) cells are exposed to each individual chemical for 24 hours and their gene expression is profiled on the L1000 platform. Each chemical is assayed at 6 doses (2 fold dilutions starting from the highest concentration of 40uM or 20uM) with triplicate profiles generated for each dose...</td>

      <td>This experiment uses 345 selected chemicals for breast carcinogenicity testing, including 120 breast carcinogens, 114 non-carcinogens, and 68 miscellaneous chemicals (e.g. nuclear receptor ligands, BU SRP chemicals, lung carcinogens). Chemical carcinogenicity and genotoxicity annotations are based on the Carcinogenicity Potency Database (CPDB), which is the result of tissue-specific long-term animal cancer tests in rodents, or breast carcinogens published from Rudel et. al., 2007. In the CRCGN project, MCF10A (breast epithelial) cells are exposed to each individual chemical for 24 hours and their gene expression is profiled on the L1000 platform. Each chemical is assayed at 3 doses (3 fold dilutions starting from the highest concentration of 100uM, with the exception of selected BUSRP chemicals...</td>

      <td>3T3-L1</td> 
      <td>This experiment includes the results of taxonomic clustering of trascriptomic profiles of 38 known and 4 suspected therapeutic and environmental adipogens. 3 digital gene expression profiling was performed on mouse NIH 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes exposed over a 10 day period during differentiation. On the Adipogen Taxaonomic Clustering tab you will find a diagram on the hierarchical segregation of compounds into taxonomic sub-modules. By clicking specific nodes of the clustering diagram you will explore gene and pathway-level signatures of expression changes shared by specific sub-modules of compounds...</td>
